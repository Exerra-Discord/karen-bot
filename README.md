## Commit etiquette

* Push small commits (e.g If you changed 2 directories, commit one directory, then commit the other directory and only THEN push)
* Use Emoji for commit titles (Read about them [here](https://gitmoji.dev))
* Keep commit titles short and then explain them in the description of the commit.
* **DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER BRANCH!** Push to a new branch (e.g username-whatyouchanged and create a PR)
